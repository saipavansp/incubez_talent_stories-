    - cron: '*/14 * * * *'
  workflow_dispatch: # Manual trigger

jobs:
  ping-backend:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        run: |
          echo "🔄 Pinging backend..."
          response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://incubez-talent-stories.onrender.com/api/health)
          
          if [ $response == 200 ]; then
            echo "✅ Backend is awake! (HTTP $response)"
          else
            echo "⚠️ Backend responded with HTTP $response"
          fi

---

## 📊 **How to Verify It's Working**

### **Check in Render Dashboard:**

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Select your backend service
3. Click **"Logs"** tab
4. You should see:
   ```
   GET /api/health 200 - 5ms
   ```
   appearing every 14 minutes (or 5 minutes for UptimeRobot)

### **Test Manually:**

1. **Wait 20 minutes** (backend would normally sleep)
2. Open incognito window
3. Visit: `https://incubez-talent-stories-4eyw.onrender.com`
4. Should load in **< 2 seconds** ✅ (not 30-60 seconds!)

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **Render Free Tier Limits:**
```
750 hours per month (31.25 days)
With keep-warm: ~720 hours used
Still within limits! ✅
```

### **Health Endpoint:**
Make sure your backend has this endpoint (it should already):

```javascript
// server.js or app.js
app.get('/api/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ 
    status: 'ok', 
    timestamp: Date.now() 
  })
})
```

### **If You See Errors:**
```
❌ ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
Reason: Backend is deploying or crashed
Solution: Wait 1-2 minutes and try again

❌ HTTP 404
Reason: Health endpoint doesn't exist
Solution: Add the health endpoint to your backend

❌ HTTP 502/503
Reason: Backend is starting (cold start)
Solution: This is normal, will work after warmup
```

---

## 🎉 **Success Metrics**

### **Before Keep-Warm:**
```
First load: 30-60 seconds
After warm: < 2 seconds
User experience: ❌ Poor
```

### **After Keep-Warm:**
```
First load: < 2 seconds ✅
After warm: < 2 seconds ✅
User experience: ✅ Excellent
```

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### **1. Monitor Uptime:**
- UptimeRobot gives you uptime statistics
- You'll know if your backend goes down
- Get email alerts (optional)

### **2. Check Logs Regularly:**
- Make sure health checks are working
- Look for any errors
- Verify timing (every 14 min)

### **3. Don't Over-Ping:**
- 14 minutes is optimal for free tier
- More frequent = wasted resources
- Less frequent = risk of sleep

## 📞 **Troubleshooting**

### **Still seeing cold starts?**

1. **Check if keep-warm is running:**
   - Verify in Cron-Job.org or UptimeRobot dashboard
   - Check "Last execution" time
   - Should show recent pings

2. **Check Render logs:**
   - Go to Render Dashboard → Logs
   - Look for `/api/health` requests
   - Should see them every 14 min (or 5 min)

3. **Test health endpoint:**
   - Visit: https://incubez-talent-stories.onrender.com/api/health
   - Should return: `{"status": "ok", "timestamp": 1234567890}`

4. **Wait for warmup:**
   - After setting up, wait 15-20 minutes
   - Then test with incognito window
   - Should be fast!
